This report analyzes the Gauss-Newton training algorithm for multilayer perceptron neural networks, focusing on its Hessian approximation and weight optimization. The algorithmâ€™s performance is compared to backpropagation in a simple network and a sunspot prediction task. Using formulas from Haykin (1999), Gauss-Newton employs second-order curvature information via the Jacobian, achieving faster convergence and higher accuracy than backpropagation. Despite its computational complexity, regularization ensures stability. Adaptive regularization could enhance efficiency, making Gauss-Newton ideal for precision-critical, small to medium-sized tasks.
